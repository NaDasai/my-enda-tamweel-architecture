= Performance Optimization

This section describes the performance optimization strategies implemented in the Enda Tamweel Loyalty Platform to ensure responsive user experience and efficient batch processing.

== Batch Processing Architecture

=== Daily Points Calculation

The daily points calculation processes thousands of client records efficiently:

|===
|Strategy |Implementation

|Chunked Processing
|Client records processed in chunks of 100 to prevent memory overflow

|Parallel Calculation
|Points calculation runs in parallel worker threads

|Database Batching
|Bulk INSERT/UPDATE operations instead of individual queries

|Progress Tracking
|Checkpoint system to resume from failure point
|===

=== Token Minting Optimization

title Batch Minting Strategy

start
:Collect mint requests;
:Group by transaction batch (max 100);

while (More batches?) is (yes)
    :Submit batch to Hedera;
    :Wait for consensus;
    :Update database records;
    :Log batch completion;
endwhile (no)

:Generate daily summary;
stop

Key optimizations:

* **Batch Size**: Maximum 50 operations per Hedera transaction to balance throughput and fees
* **Rate Limiting**: Controlled submission rate to avoid network throttling
* **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed transactions (max 3 retries)

== Caching Strategy

=== Cache Layers

[cols="1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Layer |Technology |TTL |Data Cached

|Application Cache
|In-memory (Java)
|Request lifetime
|Parsed tokens, config

|Distributed Cache
|Redis
|Variable
|Sessions, user data, gift catalog

|Database Cache
|PostgreSQL
|Query plan cache
|Frequent queries
|===

=== Redis Caching Implementation

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Cache Key Pattern |TTL |Purpose

|`user:{id}:profile`
|30 minutes
|User profile data

|`user:{id}:balance`
|5 minutes
|Cached token balance

|`gifts:catalog`
|1 hour
|Gift catalog (all users)

|`session:{id}`
|7 days
|Active session data

|`rate:{ip}:{endpoint}`
|1 minute
|Rate limiting counters
|===

=== Cache Invalidation

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Event |Invalidation Action

|Token mint/burn
|Invalidate `user:{id}:balance`

|Profile update
|Invalidate `user:{id}:profile`

|Gift catalog change
|Invalidate `gifts:catalog`

|Logout
|Delete `session:{id}`
|===

== Database Optimization

=== Indexing Strategy

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Table |Index |Purpose

|users
|`idx_users_username`
|Login lookup

|users
|`idx_users_hedera_account`
|Hedera account lookup

|points_history
|`idx_points_user_date`
|Daily points query

|redemptions
|`idx_redemptions_status`
|Pending redemptions query

|audit_logs
|`idx_audit_timestamp`
|Time-based audit queries
|===

=== Query Optimization

* **Pagination**: All list endpoints use cursor-based pagination
* **Projection**: SELECT only required columns, avoid SELECT *
* **Read Replicas**: Read-heavy queries routed to replicas

== Asynchronous Processing

=== Job Queue Architecture

[plantuml, format=png]
----
@startuml
title Job Queue Architecture

rectangle "API Servers" as api
queue "Redis Queue" as queue
rectangle "Worker Pool" as workers
database "PostgreSQL" as db
cloud "Hedera" as hedera

api --> queue : Enqueue jobs
queue --> workers : Dequeue jobs
workers --> db : Update records
workers --> hedera : Token operations
workers --> queue : Retry failed jobs

== Hedera Network Optimization

=== Transaction Efficiency

* **Account Consolidation**: Platform uses single operator account for all mint/burn operations
* **Auto Token Association**: Tokens auto-associated during account creation
* **Transaction Batching**: Multiple operations combined where possible
* **Testnet vs Mainnet**: Development uses testnet to minimize costs

=== Network Monitoring

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Metric |Threshold

|Transaction success rate
|>99%

|Average consensus time
|<5 seconds

|Daily transaction count
|Monitor for anomalies

|Fee spend (HBAR)
|Budget alerting
