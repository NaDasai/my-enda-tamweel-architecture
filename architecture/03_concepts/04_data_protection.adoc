= Data Protection and Privacy

This section describes the data protection measures and privacy controls implemented in the Enda Tamweel Loyalty Platform to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and protect user data.

== Regulatory Framework

=== Applicable Regulations

The platform is designed to comply with:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Regulation |Applicability

|Tunisia Personal Data Protection Law
|Primary regulation for Enda Tamweel operations in Tunisia

|GDPR Principles
|Applied as best practice for data protection

|Financial Services Regulations
|Microfinance and banking data requirements

|Hedera Network Compliance
|Public blockchain data considerations
|===

== Data Classification

=== Data Categories

[cols="1,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Category |Examples |Sensitivity |Storage

|Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
|Name, email, phone, national ID
|High
|Encrypted at rest

|Financial Data
|Loan details, point balances, transactions
|High
|Encrypted at rest

|Authentication Credentials
|Password hashes, refresh tokens
|Critical
|Hashed + encrypted

|Cryptographic Keys
|Hedera private keys
|Critical
|AES-256 encrypted

|Public Blockchain Data
|Hedera account IDs, transaction IDs
|Low
|Inherently public
|===

=== Data Handling by Location

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Location |Data Type |Protection

|Application Database
|User profiles, points history, redemptions
|Encryption at rest (AES-256), TLS in transit

|Redis Cache
|Session data, temporary balances
|In-memory, TLS, auto-expiry

|Hedera Network
|Account IDs, token balances, transaction records
|Public by design (no PII stored on-chain)

|Log Storage
|Audit logs, application logs
|Encryption, access control, retention limits
|===

== On-Chain Data Considerations

=== What is Stored On-Chain

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Data |On-Chain |Rationale

|Hedera Account ID
|Yes
|Required for token operations; not personally identifiable alone

|Token Balance
|Yes
|Core functionality; linked to account ID only

|Transaction Records
|Yes
|Immutable audit trail; contains only account IDs and amounts

|User Name/Email
|No
|PII never stored on-chain

|Private Keys
|No
|Stored encrypted in application database

|Redemption Details
|No
|Stored in application database only
|===

=== Blockchain Data Privacy

The platform ensures privacy by:

* **Account Pseudonymity**: Hedera account IDs are not linked to user identity on-chain
* **Off-Chain PII**: All personally identifiable information stored in traditional database
* **Link Protection**: The mapping between user ID and Hedera account is protected in the application database
* **Minimal On-Chain Data**: Only essential token operations recorded on Hedera

== Encryption Standards

=== Encryption in Transit

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Connection |Protocol

|Client to API
|TLS 1.3

|Service to Database
|TLS/SSL

|Service to Redis
|TLS

|Service to Hedera
|HTTPS/TLS

|Internal Services
|mTLS (Kubernetes)
|===

== User Rights Management

=== Supported User Rights

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Right |Implementation |Limitations

|Right to Access
|User can view all their data via profile and history endpoints
|Audit logs access restricted to admins

|Right to Rectification
|Users can update profile information
|Historical transaction data immutable

|Right to Erasure
|Account deactivation
|On-chain data cannot be deleted (public ledger)

|Right to Access Data
|Endpoint provides user data
|Token balance viewable on Hedera explorer

|Right to Restriction
|Account can be suspended by admin
|Existing on-chain balance preserved
